description: 

Generally speaking, we don't recommend using Tor with a VPN unless you're an advanced user who knows how to configure both in a way that doesn't compromise your privacy. However, a VPN may help if Tor is censored by your network. 

You can find more detailed information about Tor + VPN at [our wiki](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN).
